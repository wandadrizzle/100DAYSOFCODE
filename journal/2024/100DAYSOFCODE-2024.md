Days are tough. It's getting colder and there's all this talk about Devin. Should I keep on studying seriously or should I look into prompt engineering and data analysis? Sigh, I really need to shake off these doubts because I really won't be productive like this.

## 14 March 2024
I want to watch SpoonFedStudy's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC4jcrB4RHc) on repeat the entire day. I have been starting to feel like I am not making a dent in my studies and self-improvement journey and was tempted to quit because it seems pointless. The guy is making sense. I should focus on putting the best I can at any given moment, and realise that future me is relying on me. I need to work at making instant gratification lose it's shine, and do more things that add value to my life.

It only took me 3 days :smile: - why did I avoid this course for the longest time? The fact that something is going to take a while doesn't mean that it will never be finished. I need to develop an attitude of grit, to persist even when progress doesn't seem so apparent. Right now my gauge for progress are these certificates - consistency, follow-through and hours spent on a subject or thing should be things I use more often. I need to believe that allocating time to studying WILL bring results.

## 12 March 2024
The [next certificate](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/web-development) is proving to be a little difficult. I've barely made a dent in the course - LOOK:

(This comment was made in the morning) Wait, kanti I am half-way there! That's actually good. :)
## 11 March 2024 (022)
Before I say what my plans for the week are perhaps I should quickly mention what I was up to during the weekend. Well, my laptop is dying and takes too long to start up so for the most part I did SoloLearn lessons using my phone. It paid off some-what...

![Introduction to C# COC](../../assets/certificates/sololearn-introduction-to-csharp.jpg)
![Introduction to SQL COC](../../assets/certificates/sololearn-introduction-to-sql.jpg)

Yesterday, the 10th of March 2024, I declared on [X](https://twitter.com/wandadrizzle/status/1766896181827785179) that these are my goals for the week:

 - To not break my #Replit100DaysOfCode and @sololearn streaks
 - Finish reading 'Make it Stick'
 - Do 3 @LeetCode problems (Python or C#)
 - Revise HTML and CSS (build something?)

The above is what I'll be working on.

SoloLearn courses that are "In Progress":
 - [ ] Web Development
 - [ ] Python Developer
 - [ ] C# Intermediate
 - [ ] Introduction to C++
 - [ ] Front-end for Beginners


Courses that I still want to add that do:
 - Coding for Data
 - C Intermediate
 - C++ Intermediate
 - SQL Intermediate

I think I am a little distracted. Why am I contemplating getting a Cybersecurity course just because I heard someone mention it?

16:05

I am out of SoloLearn hearts! ;(

![certificate of completion](../../assets/screenshots/programming-foundations-realworld-examples.PNG)
## 07 March 2024 (018)

Today's to-do list:

1. ~~Read Make it Stick by Peter C. Brown (Preface & 1. Learning is Misunderstood)~~
2. Start and finish SoloLearn's Web Development course
3. Do an hour's worth of a LinkedIn Learning course - Programming Foundations: Real-World Examples

Today feels like a quiet day, I have ensured to not break my SoloLearn streak but I am starting to doubt it as a learning tool. Anyway [today's reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user_status/show/801127169) was very enlightening. I plan to use the tricks they taugh as I go about learning Python, and the other languages that I MUST eventually revist.

>The good news is that we now know of simple and practical strategies that anybody can use, at any point in life, to learn better and remember longer: various forms of retrieval practice, such as low-stakes quizzing and self-testing, spacing out practice, interleaving the practice of different but related topics or skills, trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution, distilling the underlying principles or rules that differentiate types of problems, and so on.
## 06 March 2024 (017)
When the week started I said that my plans are not limited to the following, this is my progress as of the 6th of March 2024, 07:10.
This week's goals include, but are not limited to:
 - [ ] Finishing this LinkedIn learning path - [Become a Programmer: Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-programmer-foundations), I am on the 2nd course. Which means nothing considering there are 13 in total. 
 - [x] Starting and completing SoloLearn's [Python Intermediate](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/python-intermediate) course
 - [ ] Completing SoloLearn's [Web Development](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/web-development?location=2) course, TBH I haven't touched it.

Am I distracted? Yes, knowing about so many resources is weird.
 - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
 - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/)
 - [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

It now seems like I can't avoid React even though when the year started I was set on just focusing on the Angular framework. My current python phase feels like a distraction. However, since I am set on doing this the hard-and-long way during this learning "sprint" I'll allow it - I can already see how helpful it will be when I finally make the time to do a data analytics course. Oh, as if I haven't been swayed enough from my web development goals - I saw an @dart_lang tweet talking about a [Google summer mentorship program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/dart). That really made me miss Flutter. Maybe I should apply, the deadline is on the 2nd of April. Entlek, how does one apply? Do I read [this](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/wiki/Dart-GSoC-2024-Project-Ideas) and cold-call a potential mentor and say "Hey, I want to do the thing you proposed with you."? Ngathi impendulo [ila](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Anyway, this happened in the AMs.

![The certificate that I should have started with.](../../assets/certificates/sololearn-tech-for-everyone.png)

It's 08:55 and I have realised something - by the end of the 100 days I'll be a markdown and GitHub aficionado. If you'd like to see a robot dancing CLICK [HERE](https://wandadrizzle.github.io/sololearn-tech-for-everyone/).

Should I?
[![Thinking about a Python deep dive.](../../assets/screenshots/no-python-regrets.PNG)](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python)

It's 12:25 and there, done. This is wild but why don't the certificates use MY time zone?
![Course 2/13 - kancane kancane kuzolunga](../../assets/screenshots/programming-foundations-beyond-the-fundamentals.PNG)

I need to see how much of the learning path is left

## 05 March 2024 (016)
It's 10:15 and I finished the first 2 modules of SoloLearn's Python Intermediate. I really want to finish it so that I can officially rid myself of this Python itch. However, at the same time my LinkedIn course awaits. I need to finish [Programming Foundations: Fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-fundamentals-3) today!

It's 12:25 and after some lazing around I have finally finished it! You can find my notes and challenge attempts [HERE](https://replit.com/@sindiswasm072?path=folder/LinkedIn%20Learning%202024/LinkedIn%20Learning%20March%202024/Programming%20Foundations%20-%20Fundamentals)

![Programming Foundations: Fundamentals COC](../../assets/screenshots/programming-foundations-fundamentals.PNG)

It's 16:00 and I just finished SoloLearn's Intermediate course. Felt like I needed to finish it before spending time with Sasha Vodnik, the [Programming Foundations: Beyond Fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-beyond-the-fundamentals?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A56db2b643dd5596be4e4989b) instructor.

## 04 March 2024 (015?)
My SoloLearn streak is on 15, does this mean that I have been on my 100 day journey for 15 days or is there some discrepancy here? Anyway, I finished another SoloLearn course - as for why it wasn't web dev specific, well... that's because the person doing [the LinkedIn course I am currently doing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-fundamentals-3?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A56db2b643dd5596be4e4989b) decided to tech programming foundations using Python. 

![SoloLearn's Introduction to Python certificate](../../assets/certificates/sololearn-introduction-to-python.jpg)

This week's goals include, but are not limited to:
 - [ ] Finishing this LinkedIn learning path - [Become a Programmer: Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-programmer-foundations)
 - [ ] Starting and completing SoloLearn's [Python Intermediate](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/python-intermediate) course
 - [ ] Completing SoloLearn's [Web Development](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/web-development?location=2) course
## 29 February 2024
So, I finished LinkedIn's **Starting Your Career in Tech: Software Development** learning path

![LinkedIn Certificate of Completion](../../assets/certificates/COC-Starting-Your-Career-in-Tech.PNG)

Today I started another learning path that is titled **Become a Programmer: Foundations**. Do I feel like I am doing things in a weird order? Yes. However, I also believe that these things MUST BE done! Another thing I'll definitely need to make time for is - learning how to learn. I am grateful for ChatGPT but I want to be a real developer that uses the internet for reference and NOT be stuck when the internet is down! 

## 28 February 2024 (010)

## 27 February 2024 (009)
Getting a certificate with one's name on is nice. So, I worked on getting another. Here it is...
![A certificate for vibes](../../assets/certificates/sololearn-coding-foundations.jpg)
Now I just need to work on getting something with a little bit more significance and relevance. Something that will match and align with my web-developer goals. Doesn't LinkedIn Learning have something?

It is 15:45 and I am back to say that I found some things to go through in LinkedIn Learning

## 23 February 2024 (005)
Even though I am posting every other day, it doesn't mean that I am only doing coding related things every other day. With nothing else to show I will now give you this shabby screenshot.

![Exhibit A](../../assets/screenshots/five-days-in.png)

As I go through this challenge, I'd like to essentially commit to a language or framework - to sit down and focus on one thing but I keep getting distracted. I cannot justify my C interest. I even have a certificate to show for it.

![Exhibit B](../../assets/certificates/sololearn-introduction-to-c.jpg)

Why? Just why? Anyway, I think that's it from me for now. (23 February 2024, 09:40)

## 21 February 2024 (day 003)
3 days ago I started [SoloLearn's Coding Foundations](https://github.com/wandadrizzle/Coding-Foundations-SoloLearn) and have completed the first 4 units 
- Getting Started with HTML
- Going Deeper with HTML
- Using Attributes
- Mastering HTML

## 19 February 2024 (day 001)
It's the 19th of February 2024 and I want to try again. My goals haven't really changed - I still just want to be a better web developer who dabbles in a little bit of mobile development via Flutter.

I don't know how I'm going to do it but this year I need to spend time sharpening my knowledge in these 3 topics:
- C#
- Flutter
- Angular
