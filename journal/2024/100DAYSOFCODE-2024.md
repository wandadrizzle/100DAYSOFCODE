Getting a certificate with one's name on is nice. So, I worked on getting another. Here it is...

Now I just need to work on getting something with a little bit more significance and relevance. Something that will match and align with my web-developer goals. Doesn't LinkedIn Learning have something?

It is 15:45 and I am back to say that I found some things to go through in LinkedIn Learning
- [x] [**Introduction to Web Design and Development**](../../assets/pdf/COC-Introduction-to-Web-Design-and-Development.pdf)
- [ ] **Starting Your Career in Tech: Software Development**
  - [x] [Course: Getting Started with Technology: Think Like an Engineer](../../assets/pdf/COC-Getting-Started-with-Technology-Think-Like-an-Engineer.pdf)
  - [ ] Course: Writing a Tech Resume
  - [ ] Course: Tech Career Skills: Searching, Interviewing, and Landing a Job

Even though I am posting every other day, it doesn't mean that I am only doing coding related things every other day. With nothing else to show I will now give you this shabby screenshot.

As I go through this challenge, I'd like to essentially commit to a language or framework - to sit down and focus on one thing but I keep getting distracted. I cannot justify my C interest. I even have a certificate to show for it.

Why? Just why? Anyway, I think that's it from me for now. (23 February 2024, 09:40)

It's the 19th of February 2024 and I want to try again. My goals haven't really changed - I still just want to be a better web developer who dabbles in a little bit of mobile development via Flutter.

I don't know how I'm going to do it but this year I need to spend time sharpening my knowledge in these 3 topics:
- C#
- Flutter
- Angular
