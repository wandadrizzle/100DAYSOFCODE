# 100 Days of Code - Week 1 Summary (13 November - 19 November 2023)

## Overview

This week marked the beginning of my 100 Days of Code challenge. I focused on studying Angular using SoloLearn which has a similar structure like Duolingo.
It made my learning feel like a cool game, ultimately making keeping the habit easier.

## Achievements

- Completed the first 3 modules of SoloLearn's Angular course.
- Learned a little bit about the best practices in newer versions of Angular since I am still using v14.
- Overcame challenges in speaking about my progress when there really isn't much to show.
- I gained 22 followers on X due to sharing my #100DaysOfCode journey.

## Learnings

- The key things I learned during the week:
- Binding
- Angualar Forms
- Basic Angular CLI commands

## Challenges

- Realising that I still have a long way to go in my coding journey was scary.
- Being disciplined and focusing was difficult at times because X, the platform I have decided to use to log my journey can be distracting at times.


## Goals for Next Week

- To finish SoloLearn's Angular course.
- Start and hopefully finish a short HTML course.
- Learn and use Markdown to create a GitHub profile.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on Week 1, I feel proud of the fact that I didn't break my streak even with some network and electricity issues. 
I made the time to work, and used the time circumstances gave to me. Now I just need to do that well.
