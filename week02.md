## Today's Progress

- [x] I finished sololearn's Angular course.

## Thoughts

I need to start using my commute times better. Should I not read or listing to coding podcasts, I need to immerse my mind with techniques and information on different technologies.
I finished my first course, I already want to revise some of the topics I studied. That'd be good idea, no?

PS: Here's my certificate as evidence.
