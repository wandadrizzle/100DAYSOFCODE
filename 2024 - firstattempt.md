It's the 19th of February 2024 and I want to try again. My goals haven't really changed - I still just want to be a better web developer who dabbles in a little bit of mobile development via Flutter.

I don't know how I'm going to do it but this year I need to spend time sharpening my knowledge in these 3 topics:
- C#
- Flutter
- Angular
