Hi,

My name is Sindiswa Mkhize, I dream of being an impressive self-taught developer. In this repo ~~is~~ are my 100 days of code challenge attempts. The goal is to become a full-stack web developer but I also like to dabble in mobile development. Wait, can I say that as person who only spent 2 months on Flutter sometime in 2023? Anyway, hi.

You can follow me on following socials if you wanna.
